title: Observability Playbook
---

Observability helps teams understand how distributed services behave during deployments and incidents.
Reliable telemetry starts with clean instrumentation, framed alerts, and steady release practices.

Logging foundations require structured events, correlation identifiers, and rotation policies that prevent noisy dashboards.
Engineers should archive log samples that capture production quirks for future training materials.

Distributed tracing links API calls across services.
Trace data paired with metrics highlights when latency spikes in the payment pipeline.

Metrics describe backlog depth, queue retries, and saturation so responders can forecast capacity.
Time-series annotations capture the change windows that triggered regressions.

Summary notes highlight lessons learned.
Next steps often include cataloging incidents and sharing the playbook with new teams.
