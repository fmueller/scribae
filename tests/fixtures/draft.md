## Introduction to Observability

Observability helps engineering teams understand how services behave.

## Logging Foundations

Start with structured logs that use consistent identifiers and rotation policies.

## Tracing Distributed Services

Distributed tracing connects API calls across systems and highlights latency hotspots.

## Metrics and Capacity Planning

Metrics track backlog, saturation, and queue retries for capacity forecasting.

## AI Generated Status Reports

Automation can summarize incidents, but it should stay grounded in validated telemetry.

## Summary and Next Steps

Capture lessons learned and share playbooks with new teams.
